## About the Collection

Born Jan. 14, 1861, Dr. Henry Armitage Simpson spent his career as a doctor serving Greene County, Tennessee. He delivered close to 400 babies between the years of 1914 to 1929 based on his recordkeeping. Dr. Simpson was married to Fannie White on Oct. 2, 1887. They adopted their daughter, Audrey Eileen Simpson, and lived in the Doty's Chapel area of Greene County. He died at the age of 69 on Oct. 16, 1930, and is buried at Doty's Chapel United Methodist Church Cemetery. In 2024, the caretakers of Dr. Simpson's records, Gayle Penland Mrock (the great-great granddaughter of Audrey Simpson) and her husband, Doug Mrock, graciously allowed the T. Elmer Cox Genealogical and Historical Library to scan and digitize Dr. Simpson's numerous booklets documenting the births he attended. Volunteers and staff members spent months compiling an inventory list that included the name and birthdate of the child, the parents' names, and the civil district where they lived. Not every page of Dr. Simpson's records was completed, and many pages were too damaged and deteriorated to read. Using Ancestry.com and other genealogical resources, volunteers and staff were able to add in more information that wasn't contained in Dr. Simpson's original records. Please note that any errors or typos in this index are unintentional. If a mistake is spotted, we will work to correct it. Listed below, there is a blank example page from Dr. Simpson's record books to show the information he would have been documenting to report to the state for the birth record
